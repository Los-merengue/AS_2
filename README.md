A project on Secure Coding

Objectives
In this lab you will:
1. Practice reading program code and finding potential security breaches in it.
2. Explain how exactly do your findings threaten security of the analyzed code.
3. Categorize each finding as threatening either integrity, confidentiality, or availability.
4. Fix each finding in the code; explain how your modification fixes the problem.
5. Introduce hardenings to avoid the risks created by similar problems.
